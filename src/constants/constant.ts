These verses concern themselves with proper religious observance and practice, based on the universal vibrations as understood by the sages who first heard them, but also address fundamental questions regarding existence. This philosophical reflection characterizes the essence of Hinduism in that the point of personal existence is to question it as one moves from the basic needs of life toward self-actualization and union with the Divine. The Rig Veda encourages these kinds of questions through hymns to various gods :- Agni, Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and Soma notably – who would eventually be seen as avatars of the Supreme Over Soul, First Cause, and source of existence, Brahman. According to some schools of Hindu thought, the Vedas were composed by Brahman whose song the sages then heard",

The Samaveda samhita has two major parts. The first part includes four melody collections (gāna, गान) and the second part three verse “books” (ārcika, आर्चिक A melody in the song books corresponds to a verse in the arcika books. Just as in the Rigveda, the early sections of Samaveda typically begin with hymns to Agni and Indra but shift to the abstract. Their meters shift also in a descending order. The songs in the later sections of the Samaveda have the least deviation from the hymns derived from the Rigveda.

In the Samaveda, some of the Rigvedic verses are repeated. Including repetitions, there are a total of 1875 verses numbered in the Samaveda recension translated by Griffith.[156] Two major recensions have survived, the Kauthuma/Ranayaniya and the Jaiminiya.

The name is thought to derive from the priest Atharvan who allegedly was well-known as a healer and religious innovator. It is thought that the work was composed by an individual (possibly Atharvan but not likely) or individuals about the same time as the Sama Veda and Yajur Veda (c. 1200-1000 BCE). It is comprised of 20 books of 730 hymns some of which draw on the Rig Veda. The nature of the work, the language used, and the form it takes has caused some theologians and scholars to reject it as an authentic Veda. In the present day, it is accepted by some but not all Hindu sects on the grounds that it deals with later knowledge which is remembered, not the primordial knowledge that was heard",

A key scripture to various schools of Hinduism, the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad is tenth in the Muktikā or "canon of 108 Upanishads".

The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is estimated to have been composed about 7th - 6th century BCE, excluding some parts estimated to have been composed after the Chandogya Upanishad. The Sanskrit language text is contained within the Shatapatha Brahmana, which is itself a part of the Shukla Yajur Veda. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is a treatise on Ātman (Self), includes passages on metaphysics, ethics, and a yearning for knowledge that influenced various Indian religions, ancient and medieval scholars, and attracted secondary works such as those by Adi Shankara and Madhvacharya.`,

The Upanishad belongs to the Tandya school of the Samaveda. Like Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Chandogya is an anthology of texts that must have pre-existed as separate texts, and were edited into a larger text by one or more ancient Indian scholars. The precise chronology of Chandogya Upanishad is uncertain, and it is variously dated to have been composed by the 8th to 6th century BCE in India.

As one of the most extensive Upanishadic compilations, it comprises eight Prapathakas (literally 'lectures' or 'chapters'), each divided into multiple sections containing numerous verses. The volumes include a diverse array of stories and themes. As part of the poetic and chants-focused Samaveda, the broad unifying theme of the Upanishad is the importance of speech, language, song and chants to man's quest for knowledge and salvation, to metaphysical premises and questions, as well as to rituals.

Chandogya Upanishad is one of the most cited texts in later Bhasyas (reviews and commentaries) by scholars from the diverse schools of Hinduism, with chapter six verse 8-16 containing the famous dictum Tat Tvam Asi, "that('s how) you are."[9] According to Deutsch and Dalvi, "the entire sixth chapter is no doubt the most influential of the entire corpus of the Upanishads..`,

The Katha Upanishad consists of two chapters (Adhyāyas), each divided into three sections (Vallis). The first Adhyaya is considered to be of older origin than the second. The Upanishad has the legendary story of a little boy, Nachiketa - the son of Sage Vajasravasa, who meets Yama (the king of the dead). Their conversation evolves to a discussion of the nature of man, knowledge, Atman (Self) and moksha (liberation).

The chronology of Katha Upanishad is unclear and contested, but it is generally considered to belong to the later Upanishads, dated to the 5th to first centuries BCE.

The Kathaka Upanishad is an important ancient Sanskrit corpus of the Vedanta sub-schools, and an influential Śruti to the diverse schools of Hinduism. It asserts that "Atman (Self) exists", teaches the precept "seek Self-knowledge, which is Highest Bliss", and expounds on this premise like the other primary Upanishads of Hinduism. The detailed teachings of Katha Upanishad have been variously interpreted, as Dvaita (dualistic) and as Advaita (non-dualistic).

It is among the most widely studied Upanishads. Katha Upanishad was translated into Persian in the 17th century, copies of which were then translated into Latin and distributed in Europe. Other philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer praised it, Edwin Arnold rendered it in verse as "The Secret of Death", and Ralph Waldo Emerson credited Katha Upanishad for the central story at the end of his essay Immortality, as well as his poem "Brahma`,

This thin, crispy, golden-brown crepe is made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram). Fermentation enhances its flavor, texture, and nutritional benefits, making it rich in probiotics. Dosa is a staple breakfast dish across the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh, though its popularity has spread nationwide. The preparation begins with soaking rice and lentils, grinding them into a smooth paste, and allowing the batter to ferment overnight. The fermented batter is then spread onto a hot griddle to form a thin pancake, cooked until it achieves a delicate crispness. There are many variations, including the classic plain dosa, the spicy masala dosa stuffed with potato filling, rava dosa made with semolina, and neer dosa, a soft version from Karnataka. Traditionally, dosa is served with coconut chutney, tangy tomato chutney, and sambar, a flavorful lentil-based vegetable stew. Known for its light and healthy profile, dosa is often enjoyed with a side of filter coffee, making it a quintessential South Indian breakfast experience.",

The dal, made from a mix of toor dal, chana dal, and moong dal, is slow-cooked with aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, and asafetida. A generous dollop of ghee enhances its richness. Churma, the sweet element, is made by crushing bati and mixing it with ghee, sugar, and cardamom, offering a perfect balance of flavors.

Awadhi Biryani, originating from Lucknow, is more refined, with delicate flavors and a subtle use of saffron and rose water. Kolkata Biryani is unique for its inclusion of boiled potatoes and a lighter spice profile. Malabar Biryani, from Kerala, is prepared with fragrant short-grain rice, coconut milk, and curry leaves. The preparation begins with marinating the meat in yogurt, spices, and herbs, followed by layering it with partially cooked rice, saffron-infused milk, and fried onions. Slow-cooking allows the flavors to meld beautifully, resulting in a dish that is both aromatic and flavorful. Biryani is often accompanied by raita, salan (spicy curry), or boiled eggs, making it a complete and indulgent meal enjoyed across India and beyond.",

    name: "Rogan Josh",
    region: "Kashmir",
    description: `Rogan Josh is a signature dish of Kashmiri cuisine, known for its deep red color, rich aroma, and indulgent flavors. The dish has Persian origins and was introduced to Kashmir by the Mughals. Traditionally made with succulent pieces of lamb or mutton, Rogan Josh is slow-cooked in a blend of yogurt, garlic, ginger, and a variety of aromatic spices like fennel, dry ginger powder, and Kashmiri red chili, which gives the dish its signature vibrant red hue without excessive heat. The use of Kashmiri chili is crucial, as it imparts a mild yet flavorful spice level, making the dish both flavorful and visually striking. One of the defining characteristics of Rogan Josh is the 'Rogan' or oil that floats on top of the curry, extracted from the slow-cooked meat and clarified butter (ghee) or mustard oil used in the preparation. The dish is often associated with Wazwan, the traditional multi-course Kashmiri feast, where it holds a place of honor. While the authentic Kashmiri Pandit version avoids garlic and onions, the Mughal-inspired variant incorporates these ingredients for a richer taste. Traditionally, Rogan Josh is best enjoyed with steamed basmati rice or traditional Kashmiri bread like 'Sheermal' or 'Taftan,' making it a wholesome and comforting dish that is beloved across India and beyond. Whether served at a grand feast or as part of a home-cooked meal, Rogan Josh embodies the rich culinary heritage of Kashmir, offering a taste of the valley’s centuries-old traditions in every bite."`,
